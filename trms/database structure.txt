notes on database structure

will need a request table and employee table minimally, managers can be employees

information associated with request:
RequestID(PK)
RequesterID (FK)
DateSubmitted
TimeSubmitter
LocationOfEvent	(ID maybe?)
description
cost
Grading format (probably an ID)
Type of event (probably an ID)
filepath of attachments (no convenient way to store files in database)
work time missed
direct supervisor approval		(approval after grade is entered)
department head approval
benefits coordinator approval
dateOfFinalGrade	(will be added at a later date than initial submission)
finalGrade

Employees will have the following information minimally
ID (PK)
Name (may be single string or may be split)
claimsAmountRemaining (starts at $1000 every year)
supervisorID(FK)
depHeadID(FK)
BCoordinatorID(FK)
Password
Username maybe(id could be used)

will need grading format, type of event, location tables as well.
Grading format will simply be key value pairs to cut down on duplicates, same with type of event and location
